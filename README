# 
# This is a makefile that allows you to configure the versions of the source code and install directories for avr-gcc#
#Assumptions: curl is installed
#You are familiar sudo, because the install targets use sudo for installing to the system
#You will put the executables in the PATH appropriately

Makefile.master are the global settings and compilation.
Makefile.gccver are the local and overide settings and patches

The "all" target and builds the complete package and install everything in a default ./out/bin

In order to try this out you need to do the following:
git clone git@github.com:ricklon/avrgcc-macosx-makefile.git
cd avrgcc-macosx-makefile
make -f Makefile.435

About 20 minutes later you should have a working locally compiled binary version of avr gcc.


For quick reference all open avr gcc bugs can be found using this url:
#gcc avr bugs all open and closed since 4.3.5 http://tinyurl.com/23wjmhv good source of patches
avr libc open bugs: http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=avr-libc

MORE DEATILS:

The Makefile has the following targets, and it's recommended to run them in this order:

setup:
getsources: setup
unpacksources:
build-gmp:
install-gmp:
build-mpfr:
install-mpfr:
build-mpc:	
install-mpc:
build-binutils:
install-binutils:
build-linkprereqs:
build-avrgccgxx:
install-avrgccgxx:
build-avrlibc:
install-avrlibc:
build-avrdude:
install-avrdude:
build-avrgdb:
install-avrgdb:

The code should be working as expected at this point for compiling. Feel free to create tests to verify
that it is correctly working.
